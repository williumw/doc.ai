# Question 1: Python 3
In Python 3, write a simple program below that calculates the probability of 5% percent of a population having diabetes. 
You can use this [report to collect probabilites](https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/diabetes-resource-center/cdc-report-diabetes-by-type-us-adults/article/760827/).

# Question 2: Pandas
Using Pandas prepare [his dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) to test the probabilities for the reports above:
