My main focus for determining the duration of stay for patients was centered around age, admission type, discharge disposition, admission source, number of lab procedures, and number of medication used on the patients. I used a decision tree model to demonstrate the importance of all these different factors in contributing to the duration of the stay and that was what yielded the best testing result as seen from the comparison to K-nearest means. For future cases, I would love to have encoded the medical treatments into 1s for used, or 0s for not used and also incorporate that into the decision tree model.
